    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<article>
<p>I once again have decided to stick with the elements of the MMO Final Fantasy XIV ARR to tell create a story.</p>
<p>This is more so a process of checking what jobs and weapon types that are available to choose from. There is also the mentioning of how many times a coil run that is being prepared for has been atttempted and defeated.</p>
